# NeuralNet
Source code for an open-source implementation of a neural net for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST database. The net's architecture is based on the net described in "CryptoNets: Applying Neural Networks to Encrypted Data with High Throughput and Latency", by Dowlin et al., Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, NY, NY, USA, 2016.
